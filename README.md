## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For this one I follow the suggestion of someone in the community and did a mobile first approach.
It was fun doing it like this, normally I start with desktop first as I feel more comfortable doing this way. 
So this was different from my normally approach (getting out of my comfort zone). I will force myself to continue to do this way from now on.
Trying to kill bad habits :-)
